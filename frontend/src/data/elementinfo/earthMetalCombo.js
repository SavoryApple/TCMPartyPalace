  name: "Earth–Metal Combination (Earth Dominant, Metal Supporting)",
  description: `
    You lead with Earth's nurturing, stabilizing, and community-oriented energy, fortified by Metal's discipline, clarity, and high standards.
    This combination creates a personality that is both dependable and discerning: you are the steady anchor who provides support and harmony,
    while also bringing organization, precision, and principled thinking to your relationships, projects, and environment.
    With Earth as your core energy, you prioritize harmony, loyalty, and practical problem-solving. Metal adds logic, structure, and a drive for excellence,
    making you someone who not only creates safe environments but also refines and maintains them to the highest standard.
    You are the nurturer and the coordinator: able to build strong foundations for community and relationships, while also clarifying goals, setting boundaries,
    and ensuring that collective efforts are both inclusive and effective.
    Your strengths lie in supporting others, fostering belonging, and elevating group achievement through careful planning and attention to detail.
