  name: "Water–Earth Combination (Water Dominant, Earth Supporting)",
  description: `
    You lead with Water’s intuition, creativity, and emotional depth, stabilized and nurtured by Earth’s reliability, compassion, and community focus.
    This combination creates a personality that is both imaginative and caring: you are deeply reflective and sensitive, able to connect with your own and others’ feelings,
    while also providing steady support, practical help, and a sense of belonging. With Water as your core energy, you value meaning, artistry, and wisdom; Earth adds dependability,
    patience, and a gift for creating harmonious environments. You are the dreamer and the comforter—able to inspire healing, encourage growth, and cultivate safe spaces for emotional and creative expression.
    Your strengths lie in balancing emotional insight with practical action, gentle reflection with steady support, and compassionate understanding with grounding presence.
