  name: "Earth–Wood Combination (Earth Dominant, Wood Supporting)",
  description: `
    You lead with Earth's nurturing, stabilizing, and community-oriented energy, propelled by Wood's drive, vision, and adaptability.
    This combination creates a personality that is both supportive and ambitious: you are a reliable caretaker who helps others feel safe and included,
    while also encouraging growth, progress, and new possibilities. 
    With Earth as your core energy, you prioritize harmony, loyalty, and practical problem-solving. Wood adds dynamism, creativity, and a thirst for learning,
    making you a catalyst for positive change in your environment and relationships.
    You are the nurturer and the innovator: able to ground groups in trust and compassion, while gently steering them toward improvement and adventure.
    Your strengths lie in building strong foundations, supporting others in their journeys, and cultivating growth in both yourself and your community.
