  description: `
    You lead with Fire's passion, expressiveness, and social radiance, refined and structured by Metal's discipline, clarity, and high standards.
    This combination creates a personality that is both vibrant and sophisticated: you are a charismatic motivator who brings people together
    with excitement and warmth, but also organizes, refines, and elevates experiences through thoughtful planning and decisive action.
    With Fire as your core energy, you thrive in dynamic settings and enjoy celebrating achievements. Metal adds discernment, precision, and
    a strong sense of justice, helping you channel your enthusiasm into meaningful, well-executed projects and relationships.
    You are the inspirer and the coordinator: able to ignite creativity and joy, then shape it into lasting, high-quality results.
    Your strengths lie in energizing teams, leading with optimism and integrity, and balancing group celebration with strong boundaries and organization.
    You shine brightest when you can express yourself authentically and help others rise to their highest potential.
