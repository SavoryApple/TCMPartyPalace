  name: "Fire–Water Combination (Fire Dominant, Water Supporting)",
  description: `
    You lead with Fire's passion, expressiveness, and social radiance, enriched and deepened by Water's intuition, creativity, and emotional sensitivity.
    This combination creates a personality that is both vibrant and soulful: you are a charismatic motivator who inspires others with excitement and warmth,
    but also brings empathy, imagination, and emotional depth to your relationships, creative projects, and leadership.
    With Fire as your core energy, you thrive in dynamic, joyful settings and love to celebrate achievements and connections.
    Water adds a reflective, intuitive layer, helping you connect with others on a deeper level, adapt fluidly to change, and find meaning in experiences.
    You are the inspirer and the healer: able to ignite creativity and joy, then guide it into profound, transformative encounters.
    Your strengths lie in energizing teams, leading with optimism and compassion, and balancing group celebration with introspection and wisdom.
    You shine brightest when you can express your authentic self and help others grow through both enthusiasm and insight.
