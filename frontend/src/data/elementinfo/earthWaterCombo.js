  name: "Earth–Water Combination (Earth Dominant, Water Supporting)",
  description: `
    You lead with Earth's nurturing, stabilizing, and community-oriented energy, enriched and softened by Water's intuition, creativity, and emotional depth.
    This combination creates a personality that is both caring and wise: you are the dependable anchor who brings people together in safe, inclusive spaces,
    while also offering empathy, imagination, and gentle insight. With Earth as your core energy, you value harmony, loyalty, and practical problem-solving.
    Water adds emotional intelligence, adaptability, and a deep sense of meaning, making you someone who not only builds strong foundations for relationships and community,
    but also encourages reflection, healing, and personal growth. You are the nurturer and the sage: able to support others through both practical help and compassionate understanding,
    and to cultivate environments where creativity and emotional wellbeing flourish.
