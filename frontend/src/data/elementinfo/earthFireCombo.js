  description: `
    You lead with Earth's nurturing, stabilizing, and community-oriented energy, uplifted and animated by Fire's passion, creativity, and social warmth.
    This combination creates a personality that is both caring and inspiring: you are the dependable anchor who brings people together and supports them,
    while also encouraging celebration, enthusiasm, and creative expression.
    With Earth as your core energy, you value harmony, loyalty, and practical problem-solving. Fire adds joy, optimism, and a love of connection,
