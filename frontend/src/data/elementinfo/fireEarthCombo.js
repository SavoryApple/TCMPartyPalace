  description: `
    You lead with Fire's passion, expressiveness, and social warmth, grounded and stabilized by Earth's nurturing, practical, and community-oriented energy.
    This combination creates a personality that is both inspiring and caring: you are a natural connector who brings people together in joyful, harmonious ways,
    and ensures that the excitement of new experiences is balanced with emotional safety and long-term support.
    With Fire as your core energy, you thrive on celebration, creativity, and emotional connection. Earth adds consistency, patience, and a concern for the wellbeing of others,
    enabling you to build inclusive environments where everyone feels valued, heard, and uplifted.
    You are the motivator and the nurturer, able to spark enthusiasm and also provide the structure and care needed for real community to flourish.
    Your strengths lie in energizing groups, fostering belonging, and leading with both optimism and a steady, compassionate hand.
    You celebrate life and help others feel at home, whether in teams, families, or social circles.
