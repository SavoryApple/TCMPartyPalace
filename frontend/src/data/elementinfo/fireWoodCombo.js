  name: "Fire–Wood Combination (Fire Dominant, Wood Supporting)",
  description: `
    You lead with Fire's passion, expressiveness, and social enthusiasm, all propelled by Wood's drive, vision, and adaptability.
    This combination creates a personality that is both inspiring and ambitious: you are a charismatic initiator who sparks new ideas
    and rallies others to action, thriving in environments filled with excitement, creativity, and forward movement.
    Fire as your core energy means you are motivated by connection, joy, and emotional expression. Wood adds strategic direction,
    resilience, and a focus on growth, helping you channel your enthusiasm into meaningful projects and lasting impact.
    You are the motivator and the architect: able to ignite excitement and build momentum, then guide that energy toward ambitious goals.
    Your strengths lie in energizing groups, connecting diverse people, and leading with both optimism and a clear vision for the future.
    You celebrate life’s possibilities and inspire those around you to join your journey of creation and transformation.
