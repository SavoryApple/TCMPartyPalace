  name: "Wood–Fire Combination (Wood Dominant, Fire Supporting)",
  description: `
    You lead with the vision, drive, and adaptability of Wood, empowered and amplified by Fire's social enthusiasm and creative spark. 
    This combination creates a personality that is both pioneering and inspiring: you are a dynamic initiator who rallies others around new ideas, 
    energizes teams and communities, and thrives on both personal achievement and group celebration.
    With Wood as your central energy, you seek growth, progress, and challenge. Fire adds charisma, expressiveness, and a love of connection, 
    helping you motivate others, communicate your vision passionately, and create joyful, vibrant environments wherever you go. 
    While your Wood side points the way forward—setting goals and strategizing for change—Fire gives you the energy to light the path 
    and attract allies to your cause.
    You are the architect and the cheerleader, able to inspire loyalty and excitement for new projects, adventures, and ways of living.
